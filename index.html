          <h3>The Purpose of Varying Vagrant Vagrants</h3>

<p>The primary goal of Varying Vagrant Vagrants (VVV) is to provide an approachable way for developers to work in a development environment that matches a project's production environment as closely as possible.</p>

<p>The default configuration provided by VVV is intended to match what 10up finds to be a common server setup when working with high traffic WordPress sites.</p>

<h3>How To Use Varying Vagrant Vagrants</h3>

<p>The best part is that it's ready to use as is. Clone or download the repository and vagrant up to get a sandboxed Ubuntu server on your computer with everything needed to develop a WordPress theme or plugin.</p>

<p>You should also feel free to treat VVV as a scaffold.</p>

<p>Entirely different server configurations can be configured through the use of a custom provisioning script or by modifying the config files included with this repository. The existing configuration can also be extended significantly through the use of provision-pre.sh and provision-post.sh.</p>

<h3>The Future of Varying Vagrant Vagrants</h3>

<p>Immediate goals for VVV include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Continue to work towards a stable state of software and configuration included in the default provisioning.</li>
  <li>Provide excellent and clear documentation throughout VVV to aid in both learning and scaffolding.</li> 
  <li>Provide a method for describing environment requirements at a project level so that developers joining a project can ramp up quickly. This includes code, database, and content files.</li>
</ul>
